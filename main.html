	<h1>Why I want to become a developer?</h1>
	<p> My motivation to become a software developer stems from a deep curiosity about how technology works and a strong desire to build solutions that can make life easier and more efficient. From a young age, Iâ€™ve been fascinated by computers and how lines of code can create interactive experiences. Over time, this interest evolved into a passion for problem-solving and logical thinking. I enjoy the challenge of writing clean, efficient code and the satisfaction that comes with creating something functional from scratch. As a developer, I aim to contribute to innovative projects, constantly learn new technologies, and be part of a field that is shaping the future. This career path allows me to turn ideas into reality while continuously growing both personally and professionally.
